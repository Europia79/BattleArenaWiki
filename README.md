BattleArenaWiki
===============

In alkarins absence, he has not payed for his VPS which hosted the BattlePlugins wiki as well as 
the jenkins build server. The host has since deleted all of his files, so we are left with nothing 
but google web caches. 

Eruopia79 and Zach443 are actively trying to save the cached pages, and they are being stored in this
repository where they will not be deleted. 

After we have all the pages saved, we are going to convert the pages to WikiCreole format. After that 
a proper wiki will be set up, and all the info transfered there.
